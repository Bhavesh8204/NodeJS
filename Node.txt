-----  NODE JS -----


JavaScript engine: used to convert JS code into machine code.

It's responsible for converting the code into something that a computer can understand.

JS engines are found in every browser and are usually developed by the browser's vendor.

The most popular JS engines are V8, SpiderMonkey, and Chakra.

Node.js is not a server; using Express.js, we can make a server. Express is a framework, and Node is a server environment.

write() and writeHead() are two methods provided by the http.ServerResponse class, which is used to send a response back to the client during an HTTP request.

writeHead: The writeHead method is used to send the response header to the client. It takes in three parameters: statusCode, statusMessage, and an optional headers object.

Modules:

Modules are a collection of code.
Modules can be a single file or a collection of files or folders.
Using modules, we can reduce our code, and they provide reusability.

There are mainly three types of modules in Node:

== Core module
== Local module
== Third-party module


== Core modules: These are modules that are installed by default at the time of Node installation.
   
   Example: http, os, fs, path.

FS Module: File System Module which is used to handle files.

UTF-8 is a character encoding system. It lets you represent characters as ASCII text.

UTF: Unicode Transformation Format.

We can perform the following operations with the FS Module: read, write, delete, update, rename.

Difference between readFile and readFileSync:

readFile takes a callback which calls response.send.

fs.readFileSync: You need to be aware it does not take a callback. So, your callback which calls response.send will never get called, and therefore, the response will never end; it will timeout.

== Local Modules:

These are modules created by the user, and we can export and import them from one file to another.

Local modules are modules created locally in your Node.js application.

These modules include different functionalities of your application in separate files and folders.

You can also package them and distribute them via npm, so that the Node.js community can use them. We need module.exports to define what could be accessed from other files.


== Third-party modules: These are modules created by other users, and we have to install them in our projects.

   Example: npm install <module name>

            npm i express, mongoose
