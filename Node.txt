----- NodeJS Assignment -----


1) What is the difference between Java & JavaScript?

==> Java is an OOP programming language, and it helps to create applications that function in a virtual machine or browser, while JavaScript is an OOP scripting language. 

2) What is JavaScript?

==> JavaScript is a programming language used to create dynamic content for websites.

3) What are the data types supported by JavaScript?

==> JavaScript Datatypes:

1) Primitive Datatypes:

String
Number
Bigint
Boolean
Undefined
Null
Symbol

2) Non-Primitive Datatypes:

Array
Object

4) What are the scopes of a variable in JavaScript?

==> JavaScript variables have different scopes, they are:

Global Scope
Local Scope
Block Scope
Function Scope

5) What is Callback?

==> A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.

6) What is Closure? Give an example.

==> 

7) What is the difference between the operators ‘==‘ & ‘===‘?

==> The == operator compares the values of two variables after performing type conversion if necessary. On the other hand, the === operator compares the values of two variables without performing type conversion.

8) What is the difference between null & undefined?

==> null is an assigned value. It means nothing. undefined means a variable has been declared but not defined yet. null is an object.

9) What would be the result of 2+5+”3″?

==> 73

10) What is the difference between Call & Apply?

==> The only difference between call and apply is that call requires the arguments to be passed in one-by-one, and apply takes the arguments as an array.


















-----  NODE JS -----


JavaScript engine: used to convert JS code into machine code.

It's responsible for converting the code into something that a computer can understand.

JS engines are found in every browser and are usually developed by the browser's vendor.

The most popular JS engines are V8, SpiderMonkey, and Chakra.

Node.js is not a server; using Express.js, we can make a server. Express is a framework, and Node is a server environment.

write() and writeHead() are two methods provided by the http.ServerResponse class, which is used to send a response back to the client during an HTTP request.

writeHead: The writeHead method is used to send the response header to the client. It takes in three parameters: statusCode, statusMessage, and an optional headers object.

Modules:

Modules are a collection of code.
Modules can be a single file or a collection of files or folders.
Using modules, we can reduce our code, and they provide reusability.

There are mainly three types of modules in Node:

== Core module
== Local module
== Third-party module


== Core modules: These are modules that are installed by default at the time of Node installation.
   
   Example: http, os, fs, path.

FS Module: File System Module which is used to handle files.

UTF-8 is a character encoding system. It lets you represent characters as ASCII text.

UTF: Unicode Transformation Format.

We can perform the following operations with the FS Module: read, write, delete, update, rename.

Difference between readFile and readFileSync:

readFile takes a callback which calls response.send.

fs.readFileSync: You need to be aware it does not take a callback. So, your callback which calls response.send will never get called, and therefore, the response will never end; it will timeout.

== Local Modules:

These are modules created by the user, and we can export and import them from one file to another.

Local modules are modules created locally in your Node.js application.

These modules include different functionalities of your application in separate files and folders.

You can also package them and distribute them via npm, so that the Node.js community can use them. We need module.exports to define what could be accessed from other files.


== Third-party modules: These are modules created by other users, and we have to install them in our projects.

   Example: npm install <module name>

            npm i express, mongoose
            

Difference between argv and yargs:

The first one is a function that returns an array containing the arguments given to the current running Node.js process.

The second one is a library for building command-line interfaces.

JSON:

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data.

JSON is used when data is sent from a server to a web page.


Nodemon: Nodemon is a command-line tool which is used to automatically restart applications once any changes occur. It is easy to understand.

To install Nodemon globally:
npm install -g nodemon

Ensure Execution Policy is unrestricted:
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

package.json:
package.json is the main configuration file of the application. It serves as the manifest file of the project containing all the project's information, such as project name, author name, description, and project dependencies.

package-lock.json:
package-lock.json is a file that is automatically generated by npm when a package is installed. It records the exact version of every installed dependency, including its sub-dependencies and their versions.

Asynchronous vs Synchronous:
Sync is single-threaded, so only one operation or program will run at a time.
Async is multi-threaded, which means operations or programs can run in parallel.
Async is non-blocking, which means it will send multiple requests to a server.
